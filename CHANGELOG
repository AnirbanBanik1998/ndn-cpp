Interim changes since NDN-CPP v0.5 (2014-10-06)
-----------------------------------------------

Changes
* In MetaInfo, added get/setFinalBlockId (replaces the deprecated get/setFinalBlockID).
* In unit tests, added test-name-conventions.
* In MemoryContentCache, added unregisterAll.

Deprecated
* In MetaInfo, deprecated get/setFinalBlockID. Use get/setFinalBlockId.

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2017 Support older versions of Protobuf.

NDN-CPP v0.5 (2014-08-27)
-------------------------

Changes
* Changed ndn::toHex and Blob::toHex to output lower-case.
* In IdentityManager, added a default constructor to use the system storage.
* In the KeyChain constructor, if identityManager is omitted, use the system default IdentityManager.
* In the KeyChain constructor, if policyManager is omitted, use NoVerifyPolicyManager.
* In KeyChain, added verifyInterest.
* In BasicIdentityStorage, changed the SQL file to ~/.ndn/ndnsec-public-info.db .
* In the default Name::Component constructor, create a zero-length value, not null, to avoid null pointer problems.
* Renamed test-publish-async to test-publish-async-ndnx.
* Added test-publish-async-nfd.
* Renamed internal class Tlv1_0a2WireFormat to Tlv0_1WireFormat.
* COPYING: Changed the license to LGPLv3.
* Added encoding/ProtobufTlv for converting a Protobuf message object to TLV encoding.
* Added sync/ChronoSync2013 and the chat demo tests/test-chrono-chat. See:
  http://named-data.net/doc/ndn-ccl-api/chrono-sync2013.html
* In test-encode-decode-data and test-encode-decode-benchmark, change the RSA test key to 2048 bits.
* Added UnixTransport. If using the default Face(), try to connect using a Unix socket.
* Added ./configure options --with-std-shared-ptr and --with-boost-shared-ptr. See ./configure --help .
* Added ./configure options --with-std-function and --with-boost-function. See ./configure --help .
* In Name.appendSegment and appendVersion, encode the number as nonNegativeInteger which is always 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.
  This means that appendSegment(0) now encodes as %00%00 instead of just %00.
* In Name, added appendSegmentOffset, appendTimestamp and appendSequenceNumber.
* In Name.Component, added toSegmentOffset, toTimestamp and toSequenceNumber.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1847 If using std, put _1, _2, etc. in the func_lib namespace.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1738 Remove trailing whitespace

Deprecated
* In MemoryPrivateKeyStorage, deprecated setKeyPairForKeyName without an explicit keyType. Use
  setKeyPairForKeyName passing the explicit key type such as KEY_TYPE_RSA.

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1307 Call all callbacks where the interest matches the incoming data packet's name.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1334 Interest.getMustBeFresh() is default true.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1338 Fix FinalBlockID TLV encoding.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1846 Fix compiling if log4cxx is present.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1900 Fix compiling with ./configure option --enable-shared=no.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1924 Should encode non-negative integers 253 through 255 as one byte.
* For TLV packets over UDP, ignore packets starting with 0x80.
* Fix bug for registerPrefix with NDNx.
* Fix bug for encoding/decoding the TLV Interest PublisherPublicKeyLocator.

NDN-CPP v0.4 (2014-02-27)
-------------------------

This release uses NDN-TLV for the default wire format.

Changes
* Changed the default wire format to TlvWireFormat.
* In ./configure, added option --enable-binary-xml=yes to revert to Binary XML.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1249. Support TLV FinalBlockId.

Deprecated
* Name: Deprecated appendFinalSegment. Use MetaInfo.setFinalBlockID.
* Name::Component: Deprecated toFinalSegment. Use MetaInfo.getFinalBlockID.
* Sha256WithRsaSignature: get/setDigestAlgorithm as deprecated.  (This is
  implicit in the class Sha256WithRsaSignature.)
* MetaInfo: Deprecated get/setTimestampMilliseconds: Use the
  application-specific content to store a timestamp.

Bug fixes
* Name: Fix bug in append to explicitly make a Component to call append(Component).
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1247 Use new TLV type codes to not
  conflict with binary XML. Note:  Using this new code must be done at the same
  time as using the updated ndnd-tlv which uses the new type codes.

NDN-CPP v0.3 (2014-01-31)
-------------------------

Changes
* Added option for "./configure --enable-tlv=yes" to build with NDN-TLV as the default wire format.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1105 In Name, added comparison operators.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1085 In Name::Component, added comparison operators.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1086 In Name::getPrefix, support a negative argument, e.g. getPrefix(-1).
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1121 In Name::get, allow a negative index.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1089 Renamed key.hpp to key-locator.hpp .
* MetaInfo: Added setFinalBlockID for Name::Component, remove unused setFinalBlockID which take uint8_t*, etc.
* Moved class ExcludeEntry to inner class Exclude::Entry.
* In BinaryXmlDecoder, cache the result of peekDTag for a speedup when decoding optional elements.
* Moved validation-request.hpp to public API security/policy, and moved OnVerified and OnVerifyFailed in there.
* In Interest, added get/setMustBeFresh.
* In Interest, added keyLocator.  If the interest needs a publisher public key digest, the keyLocator type is
  ndn_KeyLocatorType_KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST.
* In Interest, if any field is changed, clear the nonce.
* In MetaInfo, added get/setFreshnessPeriod.
* Changed ndn_ContentType_LINK and ndn_ContentType_KEY to the correct value for NDN-TLV.
* In Name, added experimental appendFinalSegment, and in Name::Component added toFinalSegment.
* Moved definitions for classes Exclude, Signature and MetaInfo to their own source code files.
* In autogen.sh, don't run ./configure since the user may want to run ./configure with options.

Deprecated
* Interest: Deprecated getAnswerOriginKind.  Use getMustBeFresh.
* Interest: Deprecated setAnswerOriginKind.  Use setMustBeFresh.
* Interest: Deprecated getPublicKeyLocator.  If the interest has a public key locator, its keyLocator has
  type ndn_KeyLocatorType_KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST and the key data has the digest.
* Interest: Deprecated constructors which take nonce and PublisherPublicKeyDigest.  If needed, use the constructor
  which takes a KeyLocator instead of the deprecated PublisherPublicKeyDigest.
* Interest: Deprecated setNonce.  You should let the wire encoder generate a random nonce internally.
* Sha256WithRsaSignature: Deprecated getPublicKeyLocator.  If the signature has a public key locator, its keyLocator has
  type ndn_KeyLocatorType_KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST and the key data has the digest.
* KeyLocator: Deprecated setKeyNameType.  If you need a publisher public key digest, set the keyLocatorType to
  ndn_KeyLocatorType_KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST and set the key data to the digest.
* KeyLocator: Deprecated getKeyNameType.  KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST is supported as a keyLocatorType.
* MetaInfo: Deprecated getFreshnessSeconds.  Use Milliseconds getFreshnessPeriod().
* MetaInfo: Deprecated setFreshnessSeconds.  Use setFreshnessPeriod(Milliseconds).
* Sha256WithRsaSignature: Deprecated get/setWitness.  Witness is deprecated.

Documentation
* Move instructions for running ./autogen.sh from configure.ac to the Development section of INSTALL.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1072: In Doxyfile, fix EXCLUDE for ndnboost to new location include/ndnboost .

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1056 Fix DTAG NDNProtocolDataUnit to encode as "NDN\202\000".
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1064 Add ax_lib_sqlite3.m4, etc. to m4 directory so that autogen.sh works out of the box.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1077 Move the BasicIdentityStorage sqlite file to ~/.ndnx/ndnsec-identity.db .
  NOTE: If you have an old file at ~/.ndn-identity/identity.db, please move it to ~/.ndnx/ndnsec-identity.db .
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1088 Certificate name in KeyLocator should not include the version number.
* Fix bug in getForwardingEntryFlags: Need to check all flags, not the first flag using "else if".

NDN-CPP v0.2 (2013-11-08)
-------------------------

This release fully supports the Common Client Libraries API.
http://named-data.net/codebase/platform/documentation/ndn-ccl-api/

Changes to future versions will be detailed in this CHANGELOG.

NDN-CPP v0.1 (2013-08-09)
-------------------------

This is the initial release, with support for expressInterest for one interest at a time.  A new release
coming soon will have a Pending Interest Table and support processing multiple simultaneous interest and
data packets.
